# Stripe

I have been using **Stripe** for a few years. It's a very nice service that let's you implement card payments (and more) really easily. They have a very well documented API, and it's both easy to get started and very powerfull if you need it to be.

There is one major thing that bothers me though. The swedish phrases in the checkout does not make sense. They are probably machine translated, and should be fixed by a human.

## Phrases that needs to be fixed

These two phrases are seen on every single checkout that my customers do, and it's regarding the trial period and pricing. The current phrasing makes it look weird, and I suggest that it should be replaced with the following translation.


| US phrase             | Current Swedish phrase  | Meaning of current Swedish Phrase | Correct Swedish phrase       | Meaning of correct swedish phrase |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 30 days free          | 30 gratisdagar          | 30 freedays                       | Gratis i 30 dagar            | Free for 30 days                  |
| Then $18.00 per month | Med 129,00 kr per månad | With SEK 129,00 per month         | Därefter 129,00 kr per månad | Then 129,00 per month             |

### Changelog
